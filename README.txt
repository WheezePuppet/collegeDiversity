To compile, javac all source files. Make sure your CLASSPATH includes the
src directory (in which the edu/umw/cpsc/collegediversity directory 
hierarchy resides).

You will also need to include the following in your CLASSPATH:
  - mason.17.jar (or latest version) available inside the .zip file here:
   http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/mason.zip
  - jts-1.13.jar, available inside the .zip file here:
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/jts-topo-suite/files/latest/download

To run, cd to the src/edu/umw/cpsc/collegediversity directory. Then:
  java edu.umw.cpsc.collegediversity.Sim  (output appears in "output" dir)
